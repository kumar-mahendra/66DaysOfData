Now in next 66 days I have some plans related to project I am going to work on along with my friends.
TBH I don't know even we can make this project a success but it is always good to give it a shot . 

#### `Day 01` 

[`Home`](#66DaysOfData)
- Today we discussed how our project will look like what are our objective/expectations from this project and what we might require during this project. we are starting today by collecting some relevant data. 

#### `Day 02` 
[`Home`](#66DaysOfData)
- Today we compiled some data we had collected and search is still going on. we converted data in a csv file format with appropriate columns names and format. 

### `Day 03`
[`Home`](#66DaysOfData)
- Trying out decision tree algorithm for our project . I am still figuring out how to make most out of DT algorithm. 

### `Day 04`
[`Home`](#66DaysOfData)
- Started learning Open-CV which I will use in my project . 

### `Day 05`
[`Home`](#66DaysOfData)
- Completed Basic Open-CV concepts using tutorials, and some online courses 
- Started working on a simple project to put new skills gained in test. The project is a paintingApp 

### `Day 06` 
[`Home`](#66DaysOfData)
- Almost completed paintingApp. Just some brushup required then I will upload that on github. 

### `Day 07` 
[`Home`](#66DaysOfData)
- learned how to use mediapipe framework provided by Google to perform computer vision tasks and did some projects using that. 

### `Day 08` 
[`Home`](#66DaysOfData)

[`Day 01`](#day-01)  [`Day 02`](#day-02) 

Now in next 66 days I have some plans related to project I am going to work on along with my friends.
TBH I don't know even we can make this project a success but it is always good to give it a shot . 

#### `Day 01` 
[`Home`](#66daysofdata0)
- Today we discussed how our project will look like what are our objective/expectations from this project and what we might require during this project. we are starting today by collecting some relevant data. 

#### `Day 02` 
[`Home`](#66daysofdata0)
- Today we compiled some data we had collected and search is still going on. we converted data in a csv file format with appropriate columns names and format.

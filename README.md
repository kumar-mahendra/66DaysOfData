## Introduction
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)

The #66DaysOfDataScience is a  challenge/Initiative by  Mr. Ken_Jee, A data scientist,  started to help you create great data science learning habits. Along with the habits, you will be joining an incredible community where you can learn alongside and work with other like-minded people!

The challenge is simple, it only has two parts.
- Learn data science every day for 66 days straight. You should learn for minimum of 5 minutes per day.
- Share your progress on your social media platform of choice using #66DaysOfData

This has 3 benefits : 
- You create a habit of daily learning 
- You get used to sharing your work, something that can help you create many opportunities for yourself. 
- The community holds you accountable. This is often the missing piece for many people looking to learn new skills.<br/>


I will record the daily progress here for upcoming 66 days including today ! . Also I will share progress on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumar-mahendra/) . I am very Excited for the Journey :wink:

[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)
Today I have practice all remaining  `bokeh` Tutorials( at least tried) [here](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/tree/main/tutorial). Honestly, these tutorials involved Javascript and Web development at some places so I ignored them completely :sweat_smile: :sweat_smile: 

>KeyTakeAway -  Leaned something that can help me make my future projects looks attractive :sunglasses:
<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

#### `Day 12` 
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)

- code for the same is [here](https://github.com/kumar-mahendra/66DaysOfData/blob/main/Jupyter-notebooks/EDA_Blood_Pressure.ipynb).

<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>


#### `Day 13` 
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)
- Finished readling chapter 4 along with next chapter `Introdcution to NLP`.

- That's It for today :sweaty_smile:!!

<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>


#### `Day 14` 
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)
- Read chapter 6 `Making sentiment programmable using embeddings`.
- Embeddings give relative meaning to words using concept of vectors. Embedded words vectors with similar meaning points in nearly same direction !
- Made a model [`news headline prediction : sarcastic or not`](https://github.com/kumar-mahendra/66DaysOfData/blob/main/Natural_Language_Processing.ipynb) . 
 to check tone of news headline. validation acurracy ~ 80%
`Info` : If you want to tweak hyper-parameters , you can do that by simply passing hyperparameters in a function , I have kept model flexible so everyone can use it even without understanding whole process. 

<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

#### `Day 15` 
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)
- Winter breaks ends. Next semester begins.
-learnt and coded `Navie Gauss Elimination` method for solving linear system of equations. [code link](https://github.com/kumar-mahendra/Mathematics_of_Scientific_Computing/blob/main/Linear_systems/Naive_Gauss_method.ipynb)

<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

#### `Day 16`
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)
- NLP - Finisted chapter 6 . Topics covered : Using regularization techniques (lasso and ridge regularization) in model which may increase accracy of model, Using pretrained models of text embeddings available on tensorflow-hub

**Tech-Info** : `Embedding projector` is an online tool by tensorflow which you can use to vizualize embeddings

<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

#### `Day 17` 
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)
- Read chapter 7 `Recurrent neural networks(RNN)`
- RNN give meaning to order in which words appear. Example- LSTM (long-short term memory), a bidirectional RNN 
- Can be used even if inputs are not of same shapes.<br/>
- Read a `Cristopher Olah`'s [blog on LSTMs](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).<br/>
- Attended [`Jack Raifer Barukh`'s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackraifer/) talk on `Road to data science`.<br/>
   `Key Takeaway` <br/> 
 - Data scientist role is yet not clear to companies as they even don't know what they looking for in data scientist. So try out every single interview you can and get experience as much as you can.
 - Keep models simple and once you start something first finish it then experiment with it ...else you will never complete the project.
 - Do projects that ultimately are helpful and will be used.

<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

#### `Day 18`

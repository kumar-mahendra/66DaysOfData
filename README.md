## Introduction
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)

The #66DaysOfDataScience is a  challenge/Initiative by  Mr. Ken_Jee, A data scientist,  started to help you create great data science learning habits. Along with the habits, you will be joining an incredible community where you can learn alongside and work with other like-minded people!

The challenge is simple, it only has two parts.
- Learn data science every day for 66 days straight. You should learn for minimum of 5 minutes per day.
- Share your progress on your social media platform of choice using #66DaysOfData

This has 3 benefits : 
- You create a habit of daily learning 
- You get used to sharing your work, something that can help you create many opportunities for yourself. 
- The community holds you accountable. This is often the missing piece for many people looking to learn new skills.<br/>


I will record the daily progress here for upcoming 66 days including today ! . Also I will share progress on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumar-mahendra/) . I am very Excited for the Journey :wink:

<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>


#### `Day 14` 
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)
- Read chapter 6 `Making sentiment programmable using embeddings`.
- Embeddings give relative meaning to words using concept of vectors. Embedded words vectors with similar meaning points in nearly same direction !

 to check tone of news headline. validation acurracy ~ 80%
`Info` : If you want to tweak hyper-parameters , you can do that by simply passing hyperparameters in a function , I have kept model flexible so everyone can use it even without understanding whole process. 

<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

#### `Day 15` 
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)

**Tech-Info** : `Embedding projector` is an online tool by tensorflow which you can use to vizualize embeddings

<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>

#### `Day 17` 
[`back to top`](#66DaysOfData)
- Read chapter 7 `Recurrent neural networks(RNN)`
- RNN give meaning to order in which words appear. Example- LSTM (long-short term memory), a bidirectional RNN 
- Can be used even if inputs are not of same shapes.<br/>
- Read a `Cristopher Olah`'s [blog on LSTMs](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).<br/>
- Attended [`Jack Raifer Barukh`'s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackraifer/) talk on `Road to data science`.<br/>
   `Key Takeaway` <br/> 
 - Data scientist role is yet not clear to companies as they even don't know what they looking for in data scientist. So try out every single interview you can and get experience as much as you can.
 - Keep models simple and once you start something first finish it then experiment with it ...else you will never complete the project.
 - Do projects that ultimately are helpful and will be used.

<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
